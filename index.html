                  <h1>  Phani Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Laalith Comics. 
                    The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, 
                    and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 
                    (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Phani Man #1 (May 1968).
                    A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Phani"  suffers a severe chest injury 
                    during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized 
                    suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological 
                    devices he designed through his company, PHANI Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as 
                   Phani Man. Although at first concealing his true identity,Phani eventually publicly reveals himself to be Phani Man.</h1>
